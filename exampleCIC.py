    Example of the usage of the module for a cylindrical ionization chamber.

    Explanation of the variables in detail:

    dpp           : Dose per pulse in Gy.
    alpha         : Volume recombination parameter in m^{3} s^{-1}. Usually we 
                    are using a value between 0.9E-12 m^{3} s^{-1} up to 1.5E-12 m^{3} s^{-1}.
    pulseDuration : Pulse duration of the beam in s.
    temperature   : Temperature of the air in the ionization chamber in degree Celsius.
    pressure      : Pressure of the air inside the ionization chamber in hPa.
    rHumidity     : Relative humidity of the air in the ionization chamber in %.
    voltage       : Bias applied voltage in V. For spherical and cylindrical IC
                    the CCE may depend on the sign of this value.
    r1            : Internal radii of the cylindrical ionization chamber in m.
    r2            : External radii of the cylindrical ionization chamber in m.
    h             : Heigh of the cylindrical ionization chamber in m.
    Ndw           : Calibration coefficient of the ionization chamber in Gy C^{-1}.
                    The calibration coefficient must have applied all the factor
                    related to the charge released in the medium but not the
                    temperature and pressure correction which the simulation will
                    take into account.
    n             : Number of discretization steps in position. A reasonable number
                    is around 1000. You may increase to have lower numerical error.
    fig           : If true, a figure will be display with the electric field and the
                    charge densities
    eFieldP       : Flag to activate/deactivate the electric field perturbation.
                    By default it is activated.

    +- Optional arguments:
    fig           : If true, a figure will be display with the electric field and the
                    charge densities
    eFieldP       : Flag to activate/deactivate the electric field perturbation.
                    By default it is activated.
    tStruct       : Array with the time in s for a custom pulse structure.
    dStruct       : Array with the dose rate in arbitrary units for a custom pulse
                    structure. The values will be normalized internally to fulfill
                    int(dStruct * dt) = dpp
